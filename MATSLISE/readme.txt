1. WHAT?

MATSLISE is a Matlab application for the numerical study of Sturm-Liouville problems. 
MATSLISE allows one to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and to display 
them graphically. The numerical methods used are the CP methods (abbreviation for 
Constant reference potential Pertubation Method).

This version of MATSLISE does not need the Matlab symbolic toolbox. 

MATSLISE comes with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which makes the package 
user-friendly and easy-to-use. The MATLAB functions underlying this GUI can 
however also be accessed from the command line or from other scripts or functions.

2. HOW TO START?

Downloading and unzipping the MATSLISE package into a 'matslise'
directory. MATSLISE is started by changing to the
'matslise' directory (or adding this directory and its subdirectories 
to the search path) and typing 'matslise' on the Matlab command line.


3. REQUIREMENTS

This version of MATSLISE was developed on Matlab version R2013b.


4. HELP

The MATSLISE helpfiles can be accessed from the MATSLISE graphical user interface.


5. DISCLAIMER

MATSLISE is freely available for non-commercial use. 
In no circumstances can the authors be held responsible for any deficiency, fault 
or other mishappening with regard to the use or performance of MATSLISE.
